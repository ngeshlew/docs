# First: Raters

Last year, I joined a Google Brain [research team](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/healthcare-biosciences) that applies machine learning (ML) to the world of healthcare. This team works on developing new tools and technologies that leverage ML to make medical services, like identifying symptoms, more accurate and accessible. It’s a new, rapidly evolving space, but I tried to approach my UX work just as I would on any other project. I mapped critical user journeys, made storyboards, and conducted interviews with clinicians, all in an attempt to solve core user needs.

Turns out I was a bit short-sighted. Even if you’re following a good design process when working with ML products, if you’re only focusing on the end users of the final product, you’re skipping over another, equally important group. I learned this lesson when a program manager approached me for guidance a couple months back. “I know you do design,” she said. “So maybe you can help me work out how to explain some new guidelines to my raters?”

Raters are the people who teach machines to learn. As opposed to the end users that designers often think about, raters are the equally important “starting” users.
