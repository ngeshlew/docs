Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun to take the world by storm. Yet, in the design world, it's often misunderstood and underutilized.

AI offers the potential to solve problems at an unprecedented scale. But to provide solutions to product users, AI requires human insight that is rooted in empathy. That’s where user experience (UX) design comes in.

Watch this Master Class to discover how working with AI can transform both your career prospects and the experiences you design. You’ll learn:

You’ll learn from Greg Nudelman’s 20+ years of in-depth experience as a designer and strategist for AI-based applications. By learning how to train and leverage AI in your work, you can gain in-demand technical and practical skills, and become highly employable.

77% of today’s devices already use some form of AI, and 84% of global organizations believe that AI will give them a competitive edge. There’s already a strong business case for AI and the technological capabilities to support it. So, when you develop AI-specific UX design skills, you develop a strong competitive advantage for the future.

Greg Nudelman is a UX Designer and Product Strategist for Artificial Intelligence applications.

For over 20 years, he has helped his clients—including Intuit, Cisco, Oracle, eBay, USAA, Wells Fargo, Safeway, Associated Press, and Groupon—to create a loyal customer following and generate value amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.

An internationally acclaimed design workshop leader and accredited graduate course instructor, Greg has delivered over a 100 keynotes and workshops in 18 countries. He is also a widely-known author. His latest book, "UX for AI" is slated for release in 2023.
