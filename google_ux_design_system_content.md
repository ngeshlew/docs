# UX Design as Dance Theater

Euphrates Dahout is a Google UX Designer and the architect of the world’s most popular Figma library, the [M3 Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460). Here, she shares how her love of a ’90s music video — and background in dance — has shaped the way she approaches design systems and user experience.

Have you ever seen the music video for Daft Punk’s “[Around the World](https://youtu.be/K0HSD_i2DvA)” from 1997? If not, take a few minutes to watch it. It features a captivating spectacle of synchronized swimmers, dancing mummies, and writhing skeletons — all set in a surrealist dreamscape backlit by glowing lights. Each group dances to its own beat, until the end when they come together to perform in unison.
