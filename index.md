# AI Product Engineer Course (Internal)

This internal site teaches AI and LLM concepts while building a customer‑service chatbot capstone (using Rivet). Content is attribution‑rich and compiled from curated sources.

## What you'll find
- Expert modules: theory → practice → evaluation

- Perspectives: multiple authoritative sources per concept
- Competitor watch and News

Start with Modules, then follow the Capstone track.
