# AI Prompting Best Practices

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we aim to delve into the art and science of crafting effective prompts for generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools. The ability to communicate effectively with AI is becoming increasingly crucial in various fields, from creative writing to data analysis. This tutorial is designed to enhance your skills in interacting with AI, particularly with the popular tool, ChatGPT.

## Understanding AI Prompting

### What is Prompting?

At its core, prompting is the act of providing a generative AI tool, like ChatGPT, with a query to generate a desired output. These prompts can range from simple questions to complex instructions, depending on what you aim to achieve with the AI's response. The quality and structure of the prompt significantly influence the relevance, accuracy, and usefulness of the AI's response.

### Importance of Effective Prompts

Why focus on prompting? Because the way we communicate with AI determines the effectiveness of its assistance. An effectively crafted prompt leads to precise and relevant responses, saving time and improving the overall user experience. On the other hand, a poorly structured prompt can result in vague, irrelevant, or even misleading information. Thus, mastering the art of prompting is key to harnessing the full potential of AI tools.

### Prompting as a Skill

Prompting should be viewed as a skill - one that requires understanding the AI's capabilities and limitations and adapting your communication style accordingly. It is like learning a new language; the more proficient you become, the better and more nuanced interactions you can have. This skill becomes increasingly valuable as AI technologies become more integrated into our daily lives and work.

## Core Principles of Effective Prompting

### Clarity and Specificity

The cornerstone of a good prompt is clarity and specificity. Your prompt should be clear enough to convey exactly what you need from the AI. Avoid ambiguity; be specific about what you are asking. For instance, instead of saying, "Tell me about oceans", say, "Provide an overview of the major oceans of the world and their unique characteristics." Specific prompts help the AI to understand and respond with precise information.

### Context and Background

Providing the right context in your prompts can significantly enhance the AI's response. Context helps the AI to understand the framework within which it should generate its answer. For example, if you are asking for a recommendation, mentioning your preferences and constraints helps the AI tailor its response. "Suggest a beginner-friendly hiking trail within 50 miles of San Francisco, considering moderate fitness levels", is more effective than a generic request for hiking trail recommendations.

### Conciseness and Relevance

While it is important to be clear and provide context, conciseness is equally crucial. Verbose prompts can confuse the AI or lead it to focus on less relevant aspects of your request. Aim for a balance - provide enough detail for clarity and context but be as concise as possible. For example, "What are the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet, focusing on heart health and weight management?" is concise yet provides clear direction for the AI's response.

## Common Prompting Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Vagueness and Ambiguity

One of the most common mistakes in prompting is being too vague or ambiguous. This often leads to broad or off-target responses from the AI. To avoid this, refine your prompt to be as clear and specific as possible. Before finalizing your prompt, ask yourself if there is any way it could be misinterpreted, and adjust accordingly.

### Overloading Information

Another mistake is providing too much information or asking multiple complex questions in a single prompt. This can overwhelm the AI, resulting in disjointed or incomplete responses. If you have several questions, consider breaking them down into separate prompts. This approach ensures that each prompt is focused and easy for the AI to process.

### Misaligned Expectations

Sometimes, users expect AI to perform tasks beyond its current capabilities or to understand highly subjective or personal nuances. It's essential to align your expectations with what AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, can realistically achieve. Remember, AI operates based on the information and training it has received, and it may not fully grasp highly individualized or abstract concepts.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Sequential Prompting

Sequential prompting involves building a conversation with the AI, where each prompt builds upon the previous responses. This technique is particularly useful for complex tasks or when you need to refine or expand upon the information provided by the AI. For example, you might start with a general prompt about climate change effects, and based on the AI's response, follow up with more specific prompts about mitigation strategies in certain regions.

### Creative and Exploratory Prompting

Don't be afraid to experiment with creative or exploratory prompts. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like brainstorming, generating ideas, or exploring hypothetical scenarios. For instance, you can prompt the AI with scenarios like, "Imagine a world where renewable energy is the only power source – how would daily life change?" Such prompts encourage AI to be creative and provide unique perspectives.

### Leveraging Implicit Knowledge

AI tools like ChatGPT have a vast repository of implicit knowledge obtained from their training data. You can leverage this by crafting prompts that tap into this knowledge base. For example, asking the AI to compare different programming languages based on certain criteria can yield insights that are informed by a wide range of sources and perspectives.

## Practical Exercises using ChatGPT

### Interactive Examples

To help you put these principles into practice, let us try some interactive exercises using ChatGPT. For each exercise, we will provide a scenario and a sample prompt. Your task is to refine the prompt based on the principles we have discussed.

**Exercise 1:**
- **Scenario**: You want to learn about the history of the internet.
- **Initial Prompt**: "Tell me about the internet."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Provide a concise history of the internet, focusing on its major developments, milestones, and impact on communication."

**Exercise 2:**
- **Scenario**: You are looking for diet advice tailored to your needs.
- **Initial Prompt**: "I need diet tips."
- **Refined Prompt**: "What are some healthy diet tips for someone with a sedentary lifestyle and lactose intolerance?"

### Case Studies

Next, let us analyze some real-world examples of effective and ineffective prompts. We will dissect each prompt, identify where it excels or falls short, and suggest improvements.

**Case Study 1:**
- **Ineffective Prompt**: "How do I make my business successful?"
- **Analysis**: This prompt is too broad and lacks specificity.
- **Improved Prompt**: "What are key strategies for increasing customer engagement and loyalty in a small online retail business?"

**Case Study 2:**
- **Effective Prompt**: "Compare the environmental impacts of electric cars versus gasoline cars, focusing on carbon emissions and resource usage."
- **Analysis**: This prompt is clear, specific, and directly asks for a comparative analysis, guiding the AI to provide a focused and informative response.

## Ethics and Best Practices

### Responsible Use of AI

When using AI, it's crucial to practice ethical prompting. This means avoiding prompts that could lead the AI to generate harmful, biased, or misleading content. Always consider the potential impact of your prompts and the responses they might elicit. For example, avoid prompts that could perpetuate stereotypes or spread misinformation.

### Privacy and Sensitivity

Be mindful of privacy and sensitivity issues when inputting data into AI systems. Avoid sharing personal or sensitive information in your prompts and be cautious about how you use the information provided by AI. Remember that while AI responses are generated based on a vast dataset, they should not be considered as personal advice or counsel.

### Adapting to Different AI Tools

While this tutorial focuses on ChatGPT, the principles of effective prompting are applicable to various generative AI tools. Each AI tool may have specific capabilities and limitations, so it's important to understand the nuances of the tool you are using. Experiment with different AI tools and adapt your prompting techniques to suit each tool's unique features and strengths.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored the fundamentals of crafting effective AI prompts. We have covered the importance of clarity, specificity, and context in prompts, and discussed common mistakes to avoid. We delved into advanced techniques like sequential and creative prompting and provided practical exercises and case studies to enhance your understanding.

Effective prompting is a skill that improves with practice. We encourage you to continue experimenting with different prompts and AI tools. Pay attention to how different prompts yield different responses, and refine your approach based on your experiences. Remember, the goal is to communicate with AI as efficiently and effectively as possible, and this comes with time and practice.

As AI continues to evolve, the skill of effective prompting will become increasingly valuable. We hope this tutorial has provided you with a solid foundation to enhance your AI interactions and that you feel more confident in your ability to craft effective prompts.

# Designing Use-Case Prompt Suggestions

Use-case prompt suggestions are intended to help users understand what they can use the AI tool for and how to interact with it. When designed well, they set accurate expectations for the system and guide users toward effective prompting.

## In This Article:

- Defining Use-Case Prompt Suggestions
- Designing Use-Case Prompt Suggestions: Simple vs. Complex
- Helping New Users Quickly Understand What the System Can Do
- Teaching and Inspiring Active Users to Use the System Effectively
- Use Analytics to Optimize Prompt Suggestions

## Defining Use-Case Prompt Suggestions

Use-case prompt suggestions are examples of good AI prompts. They are displayed within most AI tools, usually (but not only) to novice users.

Unlike other types of prompt suggestions, which focus on continuing a conversation (followup suggestions) or helping users complete the prompt (prompt autocomplete), use-case prompt suggestions aim to support learnability - helping users quickly understand what the genAI tool can do for them and how.

## Designing Use-Case Prompt Suggestions: Simple vs. Complex

Use-case prompt suggestions vary widely in complexity - from short phrases or single-sentence examples to rich, realistic formats like entire conversations, images, or videos that show full user-system interactions.

![Diagram showing five levels of AI prompt complexity, from "Pancake ideas" to video demos, progressing from simple to complex suggestions with examples.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/06/20/prompt-suggestion-complexity-final.png)
<sub>Source: *Nielsen Norman Group*, NN/g Team (2025).</sub>

Choosing the right level of complexity depends on several key factors:

- How broad or specialized the AI system's capabilities are
- How familiar users are with AI in general
- The complexity of the typical tasks users perform
- Where in the interface the prompt suggestion appears

Simple, clickable prompts placed inside or near the input field work well for broad systems and low-complexity tasks.

Complex prompt suggestions are better suited for specialized systems and high-complexity tasks, where rich examples provide more meaningful guidance.

While users are more likely to engage with quick, actionable prompts, rich examples can help them develop a deeper understanding of how to interact with the system effectively.

![Chat interface with prompt bar labeled "Ask anything" and options like Attach, Search, Reason, and Voice, plus task buttons like Summarize text and Analyze data.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/06/17/chat-gpt-simple-use-case-prompt-suggestion.png)
<sub>Source: *Nielsen Norman Group*, NN/g Team (2025).</sub>

Prompt complexity also affects how suggestions should be displayed. Simple prompts take up little space, allowing multiple suggestions to be shown at once. This is ideal for inline layouts or suggestion lists.

Complex prompts, however, require more screen real estate and are better presented one at a time, such as in a carousel, expandable section, or example library.

Ultimately, designers must balance two competing goals when choosing the complexity and format of prompt suggestions:

1. Helping new users quickly understand what the system can do
2. Teaching and inspiring active users to use the system effectively

## Helping New Users Quickly Understand What the System Can Do

The primary goal of helping users understand what an AI tool or feature can do is to encourage them to start using it and ultimately increase adoption. This is especially important for unauthenticated users, as organizations hope to convert them into long-term, paying customers.

At this stage, users are typically:

- Just discovering the tool
- Exploring its capabilities
- Deciding whether to register, try it out, or subscribe

To support this last decision, companies often display simple, curated examples in the preauthentication view. These static suggestions act as marketing nudges: they are quick to scan, easy to understand, and designed to clearly communicate the tool's key capabilities, ideally motivating users to create an account and get started.

### Highlight Key System Capabilities

For curated use-case prompt suggestions to be effective, their content must be tailored to the user's level of experience and likely objectives. This alignment helps showcase the AI system's capabilities in a way that feels relevant and actionable, while also setting realistic expectations for interaction.

A critical consideration is deciding which strengths of the AI system to highlight. Depending on the tool's purpose and audience, prompt suggestions might emphasize abilities such as:

- Content creation
- Problem solving
- Ideation

The features showcased should reflect potential users' most common goals. The more closely these suggestions align with user needs, the more likely they are to drive engagement and convert new visitors into active users.

While most AI tools support a wide variety of use cases, it's the product team's responsibility to identify a focused set of high-impact capabilities. Highlighting the most broadly relevant strengths ensures that the prompt suggestions appeal to the largest possible share of users - especially in early interactions like the preauthentication experience.

### Showcase Functionality with Minimal Friction

# Prompt Suggestions

Prompt suggestions are a common design element in AI-chat features, but users often ignore them, especially when they're not in the right place or don't feel useful. Done well, though, prompt suggestions can guide, inspire, and help users complete tasks efficiently.

## In This Article:

- What Are Prompt Suggestions?
- The Purpose of Prompt Suggestions
- Three Types of AI-Prompt Suggestions

## What Are Prompt Suggestions?

Prompt suggestions are typically used in generative-AI (genAI) systems that accept open-text prompts from users. When people first begin using an AI system, they're often faced with the "blank page" problem and must think about how they could use the product.

> Prompt suggestions are system-generated hints that guide users in forming queries or commands for AI tools. These can be full questions, phrases, or even single keywords that aim to showcase system capabilities, reduce user effort, or encourage exploration.

### Prompt Suggestions vs. Search Suggestions

Prompt suggestions play a similar role to search suggestions.

> Traditional search suggestions are recommended queries that appear below the search box as users type in their search query. They change as users type each letter of their query.

> Enriched search suggestions are expanded recommendations for site content presented to the user during on-site search and shown under the search box, before or while the user types a query. Before the user starts typing, for example, the system may suggest popular, trending, or frequently searched items.

![Enriched search suggestions: Amazon showed enriched search suggestions, based on previous searches.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/04/23/222.png)
<sub>Source: *Nielsen Norman Group*, NN/g Team (2025).</sub>

Unlike search suggestions, prompt suggestions are not just about predicting the end of a sentence. Instead, they often aim to inspire interaction and guide discovery of the AI tool's capabilities. They set expectations for what the system can do, and how they should interact with it.

Especially for new genAI users (which is still a large segment of the population currently), this feature is critical for supporting discoverability and learnability.

<sub>Source: *Nielsen Norman Group*, NN/g Team (2025).</sub>

## The Purpose of Prompt Suggestions

When designed thoughtfully, prompt suggestions can significantly improve the user experience of AI tools. Well-designed prompt suggestions can:

- **Reduce cognitive load**: By offering ideas or phrasing, prompt suggestions lower the effort required to get started.
- **Reduce interaction cost**: If the prompt suggestion is right, users can skip typing.
- **Encourage engagement**: Good suggestions lead users to explore topics and tasks they might have missed (or considered impossible to perform with the AI tool).
- **Improve task efficiency**: They help users formulate better prompts, especially when they're unsure how to begin or what to ask.

One participant in a recent genAI study that we conducted told us:

> "I do really like [the prompt suggestions] because they [included] a lot of questions [...] I didn't even realize I had. [...] I definitely like that it triggered a thought process that I forgot I even had in my head."

## Three Types of AI-Prompt Suggestions

There are currently three different approaches to prompt suggestions, each with a slightly different purpose:

- **Use-case prompt suggestions**: support system learnability and creativity
- **Prompt-autocomplete suggestions**: increase efficiency
- **Followup-question suggestions**: increase engagement

This article provides a high-level overview of all three types of prompt suggestions. Separate articles will discuss design considerations and best practices for each.

### Use-Case Prompt Suggestions

Use-case prompt suggestions are examples of good AI prompts. They are displayed within most AI tools, usually (but not only) to novice users. They are intended to help users understand what they can use the AI tool for and how to interact with it. When designed well, they set accurate expectations for the system and guide users toward effective prompting.

# Prompt Engineering Guide for UX/UI Designers

Prompt engineering involves designing and refining prompts to elicit desired responses from artificial intelligence models. It entails crafting specific inputs to guide the AI's output towards useful, relevant, and accurate results, aiming to maximize effectiveness and reliability.

With the development and widespread use of advanced language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 from OpenAI, prompt engineering has become a critical skill. To be successful in it, It requires an understanding of both the AI's capabilities and the nuances of natural language. Despite its challenges, effective prompt engineering can significantly enhance the performance and usefulness of AI systems.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting specific inputs, called "prompts," to guide AI models to produce desired and useful outputs. Think of it as giving clear instructions to a very smart assistant so that it understands exactly what you need.

While the general idea of crafting inputs for desired outputs in computing has been around for much longer, the specific practice of prompt engineering tailored to large language models is only a few years old. The rapid advancement in AI technology has made this a critical area of focus for maximizing the utility and accuracy of AI-generated responses.

## 5 Components of Prompt Engineering

Here are key components of prompt engineering that come in handy when you as a designer write prompts. Use them as quality checks everytime you write a prompt. This may come in handy when using UXPin's AI Component Creator, a feature that creates code-backed UI components for you. There are 5 key components of engineering prompts.

1. **Clarity**: Ensuring the prompt is clear and unambiguous so the AI understands the request accurately. Instead of requesting, "Design a car interface," say, "Design a minimalistic electric car interface, focusing on sustainability aspects."
2. **Context**: Providing sufficient context to help the AI generate relevant responses. Instead of writing, "Design a website," say, "Design a modern, user-friendly e-commerce website for a fashion brand, featuring a clean layout, easy navigation, and vibrant colors."
3. **Specificity**: Being specific about the information or format needed. First prompt: "Create a MedTech logo." Refined prompt: "Create a minimalist logo for a MedTech startup, using blue and white colors and incorporating a geometric shape."
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously testing and refining prompts to improve results. Instead of saying, "Suggest some fonts," say, "Suggest some modern, sans-serif fonts suitable for a tech company's website."
5. **Constraints**: Adding constraints or guidelines to narrow down the AI's responses. Instead of saying, "Design a poster," say, "Design a poster for a music festival, featuring vibrant colors, bold typography, and a central image of a guitar, but feel free to add other musical elements."

## What are the Challenges of Prompt Engineering in 2024?

1. **Ambiguity in Language**: Natural language is often ambiguous, and crafting prompts that remove this ambiguity can be difficult.
2. **Model Limitations**: AI models have limitations and biases, which can affect the quality of the response regardless of how well the prompt is designed.
3. **Context Management**: Ensuring the AI understands and maintains the context throughout the conversation or task can be challenging.
4. **Unexpected Outputs**: Even well-crafted prompts can sometimes produce unexpected or irrelevant responses.
5. **Balancing Specificity and Flexibility**: Creating prompts that are specific enough to get useful responses but flexible enough to handle a variety of inputs is a delicate balance.
6. **Complexity of Requests**: For more complex tasks, it can be challenging to break down the request into a prompt that the AI can handle effectively.
7. **Evaluating Responses**: Determining the quality and accuracy of AI responses can be subjective and context-dependent, making it difficult to measure the success of a prompt.

## How Can Designers Write Prompts?

Andrej Karpathy, Former Director of AI at Tesla and a key figure in the AI community, is quoted saying, "The hottest programming language is English." For prompt engineering, you don't need much but inquisitiveness, imagination, and refinements. Let's see how to write a good prompt as a designer.

### Anthropomorphize your prompts

Another notable figure in the AI community, Gwern Branwen, has shared insights on what constitutes a good prompt in the context of prompt engineering. According to Gwern, a well-crafted prompt is essential for eliciting the best possible responses from AI models.

Gwern suggests that a good strategy is to make prompts more relatable by framing them in a human-like manner. This involves testing various prompts to see how the AI interprets them and adjusting accordingly to align with the intended output. For instance, if a prompt leads to an irrelevant or off-topic response, it may need rephrasing or additional context.

### Start simple and refine your prompts

Gwern also emphasizes the importance of iteratively refining prompts. This involves experimenting with different wordings and structures to see which ones produce the desired output. For example, converting a problem into a dialogue format or breaking down a task into smaller steps can significantly improve the AI's performance.

### Break down complex tasks

When working with AI models, it's beneficial to break down complex tasks into simpler, manageable subtasks. This approach is similar to how designers tackle intricate projects by dividing them into modular components.

Complex tasks can lead to higher error rates, so redefining them as a series of simpler steps can improve accuracy and efficiency. Each subtask's output can serve as the input for the next, creating a smooth workflow that ensures better results from the AI.

This method not only simplifies the process but also helps in maintaining the quality and consistency of the final output.

### Provide references and examples

According to Rachel Thomas, a leader in AI education, giving clear and structured prompts, along with examples, is crucial. This involves specifying the steps required for a task, using delimiters to demarcate sections of text, and providing examples to guide the AI in following a specific style or format. By doing so, prompt engineers can enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs.

### Ask ChatGPT to adopt a persona

Asking the AI model to adopt a persona is a powerful strategy in prompt engineering that enhances relevance and accuracy, making the AI's responses more effective and aligned with user expectations.

Plus, when an AI model adopts a specific persona, it maintains a consistent tone and style throughout its responses. This is especially important for tasks requiring a particular voice or character, such as customer service interactions, educational content, or UX writing.

### Ask ChatGPT if it missed anything

This tactic involves prompting the AI model to review its previous responses to identify any potential gaps or missing information. Essentially, it acts as a form of quality control, encouraging the model to self-check and ensure that all relevant aspects of a task or question have been addressed.

After generating initial design suggestions or critiques, a designer can prompt the model with, "Have you missed any important design principles or best practices in your previous feedback?" This can help catch any overlooked elements, ensuring that the feedback is thorough and complete.

This ensures that all critical aspects of a design are considered, leading to more robust and well-rounded design solutions.

## Practice Prompt Engineering as a UX/UI Designer

By understanding and applying prompt engineering, designers can harness the power of AI to enhance their creativity, streamline their workflow, and produce high-quality, relevant designs more efficiently.

Yes, Google Prompting Essentials teaches meta-prompting. With meta-prompting, you can enlist gen AI's help to design an effective prompt, or take one you've already designed to the next level. Meta-prompting comes with its own set of best practices, called power-up strategies. These strategies are covered in Module 4 of the course.

## What AI tools will I learn about in Google Prompting Essentials?

In this course, we'll demonstrate how to prompt design using Gemini and other Google AI tools, like Gemini for Google Workspace and Google AI Studio. However, all of the prompting techniques and best practices you'll learn in this course can be applied across any gen AI tool or model of your choice.

## What's the difference between Google AI Essentials and Google Prompting Essentials?

Both courses are beginner friendly and have no prerequisite requirements, but both courses have a distinct focus.

Google AI Essentials teaches foundational AI concepts and definitions, and discusses common AI use cases for both individuals and organizations. Google Prompting Essentials focuses on teaching individuals how to effectively instruct AI by following 5 easy steps to build effective prompts that make AI work for them.

## Is this course teaching me how to become a prompt engineer?

No, this course does not prepare you for a job as a prompt engineer. While Prompting Essentials will teach you the basics of prompt design as well as some advanced prompting techniques, it does not prepare you for a dedicated role as a prompt engineer. However, this course teaches AI prompting skills that are applicable to many jobs across different industries.
