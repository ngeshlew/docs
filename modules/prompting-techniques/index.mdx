# AI Prompting Best Practices

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we aim to delve into the art and science of crafting effective prompts for generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools. The ability to communicate effectively with AI is becoming increasingly crucial in various fields, from creative writing to data analysis. This tutorial is designed to enhance your skills in interacting with AI, particularly with the popular tool, ChatGPT.

## Understanding AI Prompting

### What is Prompting?

At its core, prompting is the act of providing a generative AI tool, like ChatGPT, with a query to generate a desired output. These prompts can range from simple questions to complex instructions, depending on what you aim to achieve with the AI's response. The quality and structure of the prompt significantly influence the relevance, accuracy, and usefulness of the AI's response.

### Importance of Effective Prompts

Why focus on prompting? Because the way we communicate with AI determines the effectiveness of its assistance. An effectively crafted prompt leads to precise and relevant responses, saving time and improving the overall user experience. On the other hand, a poorly structured prompt can result in vague, irrelevant, or even misleading information. Thus, mastering the art of prompting is key to harnessing the full potential of AI tools.

### Prompting as a Skill

Prompting should be viewed as a skill – one that requires understanding the AI's capabilities and limitations and adapting your communication style accordingly. It is like learning a new language; the more proficient you become, the better and more nuanced interactions you can have. This skill becomes increasingly valuable as AI technologies become more integrated into our daily lives and work.

## Core Principles of Effective Prompting

### Clarity and Specificity

The cornerstone of a good prompt is clarity and specificity. Your prompt should be clear enough to convey exactly what you need from the AI. Avoid ambiguity; be specific about what you are asking. For instance, instead of saying, "Tell me about oceans", say, "Provide an overview of the major oceans of the world and their unique characteristics." Specific prompts help the AI to understand and respond with precise information.

### Context and Background

Providing the right context in your prompts can significantly enhance the AI's response. Context helps the AI to understand the framework within which it should generate its answer. For example, if you are asking for a recommendation, mentioning your preferences and constraints helps the AI tailor its response. "Suggest a beginner-friendly hiking trail within 50 miles of San Francisco, considering moderate fitness levels", is more effective than a generic request for hiking trail recommendations.

### Conciseness and Relevance

While it is important to be clear and provide context, conciseness is equally crucial. Verbose prompts can confuse the AI or lead it to focus on less relevant aspects of your request. Aim for a balance – provide enough detail for clarity and context but be as concise as possible. For example, "What are the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet, focusing on heart health and weight management?" is concise yet provides clear direction for the AI's response.

## Common Prompting Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Vagueness and Ambiguity

One of the most common mistakes in prompting is being too vague or ambiguous. This often leads to broad or off-target responses from the AI. To avoid this, refine your prompt to be as clear and specific as possible. Before finalizing your prompt, ask yourself if there is any way it could be misinterpreted, and adjust accordingly.

### Overloading Information

Another mistake is providing too much information or asking multiple complex questions in a single prompt. This can overwhelm the AI, resulting in disjointed or incomplete responses. If you have several questions, consider breaking them down into separate prompts. This approach ensures that each prompt is focused and easy for the AI to process.

### Misaligned Expectations

Sometimes, users expect AI to perform tasks beyond its current capabilities or to understand highly subjective or personal nuances. It's essential to align your expectations with what AI, particularly tools like ChatGPT, can realistically achieve. Remember, AI operates based on the information and training it has received, and it may not fully grasp highly individualized or abstract concepts.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Sequential Prompting

Sequential prompting involves building a conversation with the AI, where each prompt builds upon the previous responses. This technique is particularly useful for complex tasks or when you need to refine or expand upon the information provided by the AI. For example, you might start with a general prompt about climate change effects, and based on the AI's response, follow up with more specific prompts about mitigation strategies in certain regions.

### Creative and Exploratory Prompting

Don't be afraid to experiment with creative or exploratory prompts. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like brainstorming, generating ideas, or exploring hypothetical scenarios. For instance, you can prompt the AI with scenarios like, "Imagine a world where renewable energy is the only power source – how would daily life change?" Such prompts encourage AI to be creative and provide unique perspectives.

### Leveraging Implicit Knowledge

AI tools like ChatGPT have a vast repository of implicit knowledge obtained from their training data. You can leverage this by crafting prompts that tap into this knowledge base. For example, asking the AI to compare different programming languages based on certain criteria can yield insights that are informed by a wide range of sources and perspectives.

## Practical Exercises using ChatGPT

### Interactive Examples

To help you put these principles into practice, let us try some interactive exercises using ChatGPT. For each exercise, we will provide a scenario and a sample prompt. Your task is to refine the prompt based on the principles we have discussed.

**Exercise 1:**
- **Scenario**: You want to learn about the history of the internet.
- **Initial Prompt**: "Tell me about the internet."
- **Refined Prompt**: "Provide a concise history of the internet, focusing on its major developments, milestones, and impact on communication."

**Exercise 2:**
- **Scenario**: You are looking for diet advice tailored to your needs.
- **Initial Prompt**: "I need diet tips."
- **Refined Prompt**: "What are some healthy diet tips for someone with a sedentary lifestyle and lactose intolerance?"

### Case Studies

Next, let us analyze some real-world examples of effective and ineffective prompts. We will dissect each prompt, identify where it excels or falls short, and suggest improvements.

**Case Study 1:**
- **Ineffective Prompt**: "How do I make my business successful?"
- **Analysis**: This prompt is too broad and lacks specificity.
- **Improved Prompt**: "What are key strategies for increasing customer engagement and loyalty in a small online retail business?"

**Case Study 2:**
- **Effective Prompt**: "Compare the environmental impacts of electric cars versus gasoline cars, focusing on carbon emissions and resource usage."
- **Analysis**: This prompt is clear, specific, and directly asks for a comparative analysis, guiding the AI to provide a focused and informative response.

## Ethics and Best Practices

### Responsible Use of AI

When using AI, it's crucial to practice ethical prompting. This means avoiding prompts that could lead the AI to generate harmful, biased, or misleading content. Always consider the potential impact of your prompts and the responses they might elicit. For example, avoid prompts that could perpetuate stereotypes or spread misinformation.

### Privacy and Sensitivity

Be mindful of privacy and sensitivity issues when inputting data into AI systems. Avoid sharing personal or sensitive information in your prompts and be cautious about how you use the information provided by AI. Remember that while AI responses are generated based on a vast dataset, they should not be considered as personal advice or counsel.

### Adapting to Different AI Tools

While this tutorial focuses on ChatGPT, the principles of effective prompting are applicable to various generative AI tools. Each AI tool may have specific capabilities and limitations, so it's important to understand the nuances of the tool you are using. Experiment with different AI tools and adapt your prompting techniques to suit each tool's unique features and strengths.

# Designing Use-Case Prompt Suggestions

Use-case prompt suggestions are intended to help users understand what they can use the AI tool for and how to interact with it. When designed well, they set accurate expectations for the system and guide users toward effective prompting.

- Helping New Users Quickly Understand What the System Can Do
- Teaching and Inspiring Active Users to Use the System Effectively
- Use Analytics to Optimize Prompt Suggestions

## Defining Use-Case Prompt Suggestions

Use-case prompt suggestions are examples of good AI prompts. They are displayed within most AI tools, usually (but not only) to novice users.

Unlike other types of prompt suggestions, which focus on continuing a conversation (followup suggestions) or helping users complete the prompt (prompt autocomplete), use-case prompt suggestions aim to support learnability — helping users quickly understand what the genAI tool can do for them and how.

## Designing Use-Case Prompt Suggestions: Simple vs. Complex

Use-case prompt suggestions vary widely in complexity — from short phrases or single-sentence examples to rich, realistic formats like entire conversations, images, or videos that show full user–system interactions.

![Diagram showing five levels of AI prompt complexity, from "Pancake ideas" to video demos, progressing from simple to complex suggestions with examples.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/06/20/prompt-suggestion-complexity-final.png)

Choosing the right level of complexity depends on several key factors:

- How broad or specialized the AI system's capabilities are
- How familiar users are with AI in general
- The complexity of the typical tasks users perform
- Where in the interface the prompt suggestion appears

Simple, clickable prompts placed inside or near the input field work well for broad systems and low-complexity tasks.

Complex prompt suggestions are better suited for specialized systems and high-complexity tasks, where rich examples provide more meaningful guidance.

While users are more likely to engage with quick, actionable prompts, rich examples can help them develop a deeper understanding of how to interact with the system effectively.

<sub>Source: *Nielsen Norman Group*, NN/g Team (2025).</sub>

Prompt complexity also affects how suggestions should be displayed. Simple prompts take up little space, allowing multiple suggestions to be shown at once. This is ideal for inline layouts or suggestion lists.

Complex prompts, however, require more screen real estate and are better presented one at a time, such as in a carousel, expandable section, or example library.

Ultimately, designers must balance two competing goals when choosing the complexity and format of prompt suggestions:

1. Helping new users quickly understand what the system can do
2. Teaching and inspiring active users to use the system effectively

## Helping New Users Quickly Understand What the System Can Do

The primary goal of helping users understand what an AI tool or feature can do is to encourage them to start using it and ultimately increase adoption. This is especially important for unauthenticated users, as organizations hope to convert them into long-term, paying customers.

At this stage, users are typically:

- Just discovering the tool
- Exploring its capabilities
- Deciding whether to register, try it out, or subscribe

To support this last decision, companies often display simple, curated examples in the preauthentication view. These static suggestions act as marketing nudges: they are quick to scan, easy to understand, and designed to clearly communicate the tool's key capabilities, ideally motivating users to create an account and get started.

### Highlight Key System Capabilities

For curated use-case prompt suggestions to be effective, their content must be tailored to the user's level of experience and likely objectives. This alignment helps showcase the AI system's capabilities in a way that feels relevant and actionable, while also setting realistic expectations for interaction.

A critical consideration is deciding which strengths of the AI system to highlight. Depending on the tool's purpose and audience, prompt suggestions might emphasize abilities such as:

- Content creation
- Problem solving
- Ideation

The features showcased should reflect potential users' most common goals. The more closely these suggestions align with user needs, the more likely they are to drive engagement and convert new visitors into active users.

While most AI tools support a wide variety of use cases, it's the product team's responsibility to identify a focused set of high-impact capabilities. Highlighting the most broadly relevant strengths ensures that the prompt suggestions appeal to the largest possible share of users — especially in early interactions like the preauthentication experience.
