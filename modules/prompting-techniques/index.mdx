## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start Simple**: Begin with zero-shot or few-shot techniques before moving to more complex approaches.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Test Iteratively**: Always test prompts with multiple examples to ensure consistency and reliability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Consider Context**: Choose techniques based on your specific use case, available data, and performance requirements.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Cost Awareness**: More complex techniques may require multiple API calls, increasing costs and latency.
</Warning>
