# Using Multimodal AI Models For Your Applications (Part 3)

In this third and final part of a three-part series, we're taking a more streamlined approach to an application that supports vision-language (VLM) and text-to-speech (TTS). This time, we'll use different models that are designed for all three modalities — images or videos, text, and audio (including speech-to-text) — in one model. These "any-to-any" models make things easier by allowing us to avoid switching between models.

Specifically, we'll focus on two powerful models: Reka and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Both models take things to the next level compared to the tools we used earlier. They eliminate the need for separate speech recognition models, providing a unified solution for multimodal tasks. With this in mind, our goal in this article is to explore how Reka and Gemini simplify building advanced applications that handle images, text, and audio all at once.

## Overview Of Multimodal AI Models

The architecture of multimodal models has evolved to enable seamless handling of various inputs, including text, images, and audio, among others. Traditional models often require separate components for each modality, but recent advancements in "any-to-any" models like Next-GPT or 4M allow developers to build systems that process multiple modalities within a unified architecture.

Gato, for instance, utilizes a 1.2 billion parameter decoder-only transformer architecture with 24 layers, embedding sizes of 2048 and a hidden size of 8196 in its feed-forward layers. This structure is optimized for general tasks across various inputs, but it still relies on extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

GPT-4o, on the other hand, takes a different approach with training on multiple media types within a single architecture. This means it's a single model trained to handle a variety of inputs (e.g., text, images, code) without the need for separate systems for each. This training method allows for smoother task-switching and better generalization across tasks.

Similarly, CoDi employs a multistage training scheme to handle a linear number of tasks while supporting input-output combinations across different modalities. CoDi's architecture builds a shared multimodal space, enabling synchronized generation for intertwined modalities like video and audio, making it ideal for more dynamic multimedia tasks.

Most "any-to-any" models, including the ones we've discussed, rely on a few key concepts to handle different tasks and inputs smoothly:

- **Shared representation space**: These models convert different types of inputs — text, images, audio — into a common feature space. Text is encoded into vectors, images into feature maps, and audio into spectrograms or embeddings. This shared space allows the model to process various inputs in a unified way.
- **Attention mechanisms**: Attention layers help the model focus on the most relevant parts of each input, whether it's understanding the text, generating captions from images, or interpreting audio.
- **Cross-modal interaction**: In many models, inputs from one modality (e.g., text) can guide the generation or interpretation of another modality (e.g., images), allowing for more integrated and cohesive outputs.
- **Pre-training and fine-tuning**: Models are typically pre-trained on large datasets across different types of data and then fine-tuned for specific tasks, enhancing their performance in real-world applications.

## Reka Models

Reka is an AI research company that helps developers build powerful applications by offering models for a range of tasks. These tasks include generating text from videos and images, translating speech, and answering complex questions from long multimodal documents. Reka's models can even write and execute code, providing flexible, real-world solutions for developers.

These are the three main models Reka offers:

1. **Reka Core**: A 67-billion-parameter multimodal language model designed for complex tasks. It supports inputs like images, videos, and texts while excelling in advanced reasoning and coding.
2. **Reka Flash**: A faster model with a 21-billion-parameter, designed for flexibility and rapid performance in multimodal settings.
3. **Reka Edge (PDF)**: A smaller 7-billion-parameter model was built for on-device and low-latency applications, making it efficient for local use and local or latency-sensitive applications.

Reka's models can be fine-tuned and deployed securely, whether on the cloud, on-premises, or even on-device. Let's start by testing Reka's capabilities directly through its playground. This allows us to experiment with its multimodal features without writing any code, providing a hands-on way to see how the models handle various tasks, such as image and video comprehension.

Alright, we'll kick things off by uploading an image of a diagram outline of the PaliGemma architecture and ask Reka for a detailed explanation.

> Can you provide a more detailed explanation of this image?

# Integrating Image-To-Text And Text-To-Speech Models (Part 2)

In Part 1 of this brief two-part series, we developed an application that turns images into audio descriptions using vision-language and text-to-speech models. We combined an image-to-text that analyses and understands images, generating description, with a text-to-speech model to create an audio description, helping people with sight challenges. We also discussed how to choose the right model to fit your needs.

Now, we are taking things a step further. Instead of just providing audio descriptions, we are building that can have interactive conversations about images or videos. This is known as Conversational AI — a technology that lets users talk to systems much like chatbots, virtual assistants, or agents.

While the first iteration of the app was great, the output still lacked some details. For example, if you upload an image of a dog, the description might be something like "a dog sitting on a rock in front of a pool," and the app might produce something close but miss additional details such as the dog's breed, the time of the day, or location.

![The interface for an app with an uploaded photo of a golden retriever puppy on the left and an audio extraction on the right represented by sound waves.](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/integrating-image-to-text-and-text-to-speech-models-part2/1-app-interface.png)
<sub>Source: *Smashing Magazine*, Smashing Magazine Team (2025).</sub>

The aim here is simply to build a more advanced version of the previously built app so that it not only describes images but also provides more in-depth information and engages users in meaningful conversations about them.

We'll use LLaVA, a model that combines understanding images and conversational capabilities. After building our tool, we'll explore multimodal models that can handle images, videos, text, audio, and more, all at once to give you even more options and easiness for your applications.

## Visual Instruction Tuning and LLaVA

We are going to look at visual instruction tuning and the multimodal capabilities of LLaVA. We'll first explore how visual instruction tuning can enhance the large language models to understand and follow instructions that include visual information. After that, we'll dive into LLaVA, which brings its own set of tools for image and video processing.

### Visual Instruction Tuning

Visual instruction tuning is a technique that helps large language models (LLMs) understand and follow instructions based on visual inputs. This approach connects language and vision, enabling AI systems to understand and respond to human instructions that involve both text and images. For example, Visual IT enables a model to describe an image or answer questions about a scene in a photograph. This fine-tuning method makes the model more capable of handling these complex interactions effectively.

There's a new training approach called LLaVAR that has been developed, and you can think of it as a tool for handling tasks related to PDFs, invoices, and text-heavy images. It's pretty exciting, but we won't dive into that since it is outside the scope of the app we're making.

### Examples of Visual Instruction Tuning Datasets

To build good models, you need good data — rubbish in, rubbish out. So, here are two datasets that you might want to use to train or evaluate your multimodal models. Of course, you can always add your own datasets to the two I'm going to mention.

**Vision-CAIR**

- Instruction datasets: English;
- Multi-task: Datasets containing multiple tasks;
- Mixed dataset: Contains both human and machine-generated data.

![Vision-CAIR](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/integrating-image-to-text-and-text-to-speech-models-part2/2-vision-cair.png)
<sub>Source: *Smashing Magazine*, Smashing Magazine Team (2025).</sub>

Vision-CAIR provides a high-quality, well-aligned image-text dataset created using conversations between two bots. This dataset was initially introduced in a paper titled "MiniGPT-4: Enhancing Vision-Language Understanding with Advanced Large Language Models," and it provides more detailed image descriptions and can be used with predefined instruction templates for image-instruction-answer fine-tuning.

**LLaVA Visual Instruct 150K**

- Instruction datasets: English;
- Multi-task: Datasets containing multiple tasks;
- Mixed dataset: Contains both human and machine-generated data.

LLaVA Visual Instruct 150K is a set of GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is built for visual instruction tuning and aims to achieve GPT-4 level vision and language capabilities.

# Integrating Image-To-Text And Text-To-Speech Models (Part 1)

Audio descriptions involve narrating contextual visual information in images or videos, improving user experiences, especially for those who rely on audio cues.

At the core of audio description technology are two crucial components: the description and the audio. The description involves understanding and interpreting the visual content of an image or video, which includes details such as actions, settings, expressions, and any other relevant visual information. Meanwhile, the audio component converts these descriptions into spoken words that are clear, coherent, and natural-sounding.

So, here's something we can do: build an app that generates and announces audio descriptions. The app can integrate a pre-trained vision-language model to analyze image inputs, extract relevant information, and generate accurate descriptions. These descriptions are then converted into speech using text-to-speech technology, providing a seamless and engaging audio experience.

<sub>Source: *Smashing Magazine*, Smashing Magazine Team (2025).</sub>

By the end of this tutorial, you will gain a solid grasp of the components that are used to build audio description tools. We'll spend time discussing what VLM and TTS models are, as well as many examples of them and tooling for integrating them into your work.

When we finish, you will be ready to follow along with a second tutorial in which we level up and build a chatbot assistant that you can interact with to get more insights about your images or videos.

## Vision-Language Models: An Introduction

VLMs are a form of artificial intelligence that can understand and learn from visuals and linguistic modalities.

![Image illustrating four different tasks a vision-language model can handle, such as Visual QA, object localization in an image.](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://files.smashing.media/articles/integrating-image-to-text-and-text-to-speech-models-part1/2-four-tasks-vision-language-model-can-handle.jpg)
<sub>Source: *Smashing Magazine*, Smashing Magazine Team (2025).</sub>

They are trained on vast amounts of data that include images, videos, and text, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between these modalities. In simple terms, a VLM can look at an image or video and generate a corresponding text description that accurately matches the visual content.

VLMs typically consist of three main components:

1. An image model that extracts meaningful visual information,
2. A text model that processes and understands natural language,
3. A fusion mechanism that combines the representations learned by the image and text models, enabling cross-modal interactions.

Generally speaking, the image model — also known as the vision encoder — extracts visual features from input images and maps them to the language model's input space, creating visual tokens. The text model then processes and understands natural language by generating text embeddings. Lastly, these visual and textual representations are combined through the fusion mechanism, allowing the model to integrate visual and textual information.

VLMs bring a new level of intelligence to applications by bridging visual and linguistic understanding. Here are some of the applications where VLMs shine:

- **Image captions**: VLMs can provide automatic descriptions that enrich user experiences, improve searchability, and even enhance visuals for vision impairments.
- **Visual answers to questions**: VLMs could be integrated into educational tools to help students learn more deeply by allowing them to ask questions about visuals they encounter in learning materials, such as complex diagrams and illustrations.
- **Document analysis**: VLMs can streamline document review processes, identifying critical information in contracts, reports, or patents much faster than reviewing them manually.
- **Image search**: VLMs could open up the ability to perform reverse image searches. For example, an e-commerce site might allow users to upload image files that are processed to identify similar products that are available for purchase.
- **Content moderation**: Social media platforms could benefit from VLMs by identifying and removing harmful or sensitive content automatically before publishing it.
- **Robotics**: In industrial settings, robots equipped with VLMs can perform quality control tasks by understanding visual cues and describing defects accurately.

This is merely an overview of what VLMs are and the pieces that come together to generate audio descriptions. To get a clearer idea of how VLMs work, let's look at a few real-world examples that leverage VLM processes.

# Generating Real-Time Audio Sentiment Analysis With AI

In the previous article, we developed a sentiment analysis tool that could detect and score emotions hidden within audio files. We're taking it to the next level in this article by integrating real-time analysis and multilingual support. Imagine analyzing the sentiment of your audio content in real-time as the audio file is transcribed. In other words, the tool we are building offers immediate insights as an audio file plays.

So, how does it all come together? Meet Whisper and Gradio — the two resources that sit under the hood. Whisper is an advanced automatic speech recognition and language detection library. It swiftly converts audio files to text and identifies the language. Gradio is a UI framework that happens to be designed for interfaces that utilize machine learning, which is ultimately what we are doing in this article. With Gradio, you can create user-friendly interfaces without complex installations, configurations, or any machine learning experience — the perfect tool for a tutorial like this.

By the end of this article, we will have created a fully-functional app that:

- Records audio from the user's microphone,
- Transcribes the audio to plain text,
- Detects the language,
- Analyzes the emotional qualities of the text, and
- Assigns a score to the result.

Note: You can peek at the final product in the live demo.

## Automatic Speech Recognition And Whisper

Let's delve into the fascinating world of automatic speech recognition and its ability to analyze audio. In the process, we'll also introduce Whisper, an automated speech recognition tool developed by the OpenAI team behind ChatGPT and other emerging artificial intelligence technologies. Whisper has redefined the field of speech recognition with its innovative capabilities, and we'll closely examine its available features.

## Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR technology is a key component for converting speech to text, making it a valuable tool in today's digital world. Its applications are vast and diverse, spanning various industries. ASR can efficiently and accurately transcribe audio files into plain text. It also powers voice assistants, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines through spoken language. It's used in myriad ways, such as in call centers that automatically route calls and provide callers with self-service options.

By automating audio conversion to text, ASR significantly saves time and boosts productivity across multiple domains. Moreover, it opens up new avenues for data analysis and decision-making.

That said, ASR does have its fair share of challenges. For example, its accuracy is diminished when dealing with different accents, background noises, and speech variations — all of which require innovative solutions to ensure accurate and reliable transcription. The development of ASR systems capable of handling diverse audio sources, adapting to multiple languages, and maintaining exceptional accuracy is crucial for overcoming these obstacles.

## Whisper: A Speech Recognition Model

Whisper is a speech recognition model also developed by OpenAI. This powerful model excels at speech recognition and offers language identification and translation across multiple languages. It's an open-source model available in five different sizes, four of which have an English-only variant that performs exceptionally well for single-language tasks.

What sets Whisper apart is its robust ability to overcome ASR challenges. Whisper achieves near state-of-the-art performance and even supports zero-shot translation from various languages to English. Whisper has been trained on a large corpus of data that characterizes ASR's challenges. The training data consists of approximately 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.

The model is available in multiple sizes. The following table outlines these model characteristics:

- `tiny.en`
- `base.en`
- `small.en`
- `medium.en`

For developers working with English-only applications, it's essential to consider the performance differences among the .en models — specifically, tiny.en and base.en, both of which offer better performance than the other models.

Whisper utilizes a Seq2seq (i.e., transformer encoder-decoder) architecture commonly employed in language-based models. This architecture's input consists of audio frames, typically 30-second segment pairs. The output is a sequence of the corresponding text. Its primary strength lies in transcribing audio into text, making it ideal for "audio-to-text" use cases.
