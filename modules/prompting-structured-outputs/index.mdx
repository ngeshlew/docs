# Prompting & Structured Outputs

> Start reading here to learn the fundamentals of effective AI prompting and structured output generation.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively communicate with AI models. It involves understanding how to structure inputs to get the desired outputs from language models, ensuring clarity, specificity, and effectiveness in AI interactions.

*Content from [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics)*

### Prompting an LLM

You can achieve a lot with simple prompts, but the quality of results depends on how much information you provide it and how well-crafted the prompt is. A prompt can contain information like the _instruction_ or _question_ you are passing to the model and include other details such as _context_, _inputs_, or _examples_. You can use these elements to instruct the model more effectively to improve the quality of results.

Let's get started by going over a basic example of a simple prompt:

**Prompt:**
```
The sky is
```

**Output:**
```
blue.
```

If you are using the OpenAI Playground or any other LLM playground, you can prompt the model as shown in the following screenshot:

![OpenAI Playground Tutorial](../assets/www.promptingguide.ai/www.promptingguide.ai-introduction-basics/intro1.png)

Something to note is that when using the OpenAI chat models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`, you can structure your prompt using three different roles: `system`, `user`, and `assistant`. The system message is not required but helps to set the overall behavior of the assistant. The example above only includes a user message which you can use to directly prompt the model. For simplicity, all of the examples, except when it's explicitly mentioned, will use only the `user` message to prompt the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. The `assistant` message in the example above corresponds to the model response. You can also define an assistant message to pass examples of the desired behavior you want.

You can observe from the prompt example above that the language model responds with a sequence of tokens that make sense given the context `"The sky is"`. The output might be unexpected or far from the task you want to accomplish. In fact, this basic example highlights the necessity to provide more context or instructions on what specifically you want to achieve with the system. This is what prompt engineering is all about.

Let's try to improve it a bit:

**Prompt:**
```
Complete the sentence: 

The sky is
```

**Output:**
```
blue during the day and dark at night.
```

Is that better? Well, with the prompt above you are instructing the model to complete the sentence so the result looks a lot better as it follows exactly what you told it to do ("complete the sentence"). This approach of designing effective prompts to instruct the model to perform a desired task is what's referred to as **prompt engineering** in this guide.

The example above is a basic illustration of what's possible with LLMs today. Today's LLMs are able to perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation.

### Prompt Formatting

You have tried a very simple prompt above. A standard prompt has the following format:

```
<Question>?
```

or

```
<Instruction>
```

You can format this into a question answering (QA) format, which is standard in a lot of QA datasets, as follows:

```
Q: <Question>?
A: 
```

When prompting like the above, it's also referred to as _zero-shot prompting_, i.e., you are directly prompting the model for a response without any examples or demonstrations about the task you want it to achieve. Some large language models have the ability to perform zero-shot prompting but it depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand and the tasks the model was trained to perform good on.

A concrete prompt example is as follows:

**Prompt:**
```
Q: What is prompt engineering?
```

With some of the more recent models you can skip the "Q:" part as it is implied and understood by the model as a question answering task based on how the sequence is composed. In other words, the prompt could be simplified as follows:

**Prompt:**
```
What is prompt engineering?
```

Given the standard format above, one popular and effective technique to prompting is referred to as _few-shot prompting_ where you provide exemplars (i.e., demonstrations). You can format few-shot prompts as follows:

```
<Question>?
<Answer>

<Question>?
<Answer>

<Question>?
<Answer>

<Question>?

```

The QA format version would look like this:

```
Q: <Question>?
A: <Answer>

Q: <Question>?
A: <Answer>

Q: <Question>?
A: <Answer>

Q: <Question>?
A:
```

Keep in mind that it's not required to use the QA format. The prompt format depends on the task at hand. For instance, you can perform a simple classification task and give exemplars that demonstrate the task as follows:

**Prompt:**
```
This is awesome! // Positive
This is bad! // Negative
Wow that movie was rad! // Positive
What a horrible show! //
```

**Output:**
```
Negative
```

Few-shot prompts enable in-context learning, which is the ability of language models to learn tasks given a few demonstrations. We discuss zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting more extensively in upcoming sections.

## Elements of a Prompt

*Content from [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements)*

As we cover more and more examples and applications with prompt engineering, you will notice that certain elements make up a prompt.

A prompt contains any of the following elements:

**Instruction** - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform

**Context** - external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses

**Input Data** - the input or question that we are interested to find a response for

**Output Indicator** - the type or format of the output.

To demonstrate the prompt elements better, here is a simple prompt that aims to perform a text classification task:

**Prompt:**
```
Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive

Text: I think the food was okay.

Sentiment:
```

In the prompt example above, the instruction correspond to the classification task, "Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive". The input data corresponds to the "I think the food was okay.' part, and the output indicator used is "Sentiment:". Note that this basic example doesn't use context but this can also be provided as part of the prompt. For instance, the context for this text classification prompt can be additional examples provided as part of the prompt to help the model better understand the task and steer the type of outputs that you expect.

You do not need all the four elements for a prompt and the format depends on the task at hand. We will touch on more concrete examples in upcoming guides.

## General Tips for Designing Prompts

*Content from [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/tips)*

### Start with the design problem

Before writing a prompt, understand what you're trying to solve:

1. **What is the user trying to accomplish?**
2. **What information do they need?**
3. **How should the AI respond to help them?**

### Be specific and descriptive

When writing prompts, be as specific and descriptive as possible. This gives the model a clear understanding of what you want and helps it generate more relevant and accurate responses.

**Poor prompt:**
```
Write a story about a cat.
```

**Better prompt:**
```
Write a 300-word children's story about a curious orange tabby cat named Whiskers who discovers a magical garden in her backyard. The story should be engaging for 6-8 year olds and include a lesson about friendship.
```

### Specify the output format

Clearly specify the format you want the output in. This helps ensure consistency and makes it easier to process the results.

**Example:**
```
Analyze the sentiment of the following text and provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}

Text: "I love this new AI assistant!"
```

### Use few-shot examples

Provide examples of the desired input-output format to help the model understand your expectations.

**Example:**
```
Translate the following English sentences to Spanish:

English: "Hello, how are you?"
Spanish: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

English: "The weather is beautiful today."
Spanish: "El clima está hermoso hoy."

English: "I love learning new languages."
Spanish: 
```

### Set the tone and style

Specify the tone, style, or persona you want the model to adopt.

**Example:**
```
You are a friendly and patient math tutor explaining concepts to a 10-year-old student. Use simple language, provide step-by-step explanations, and include encouraging words.
```

### Include constraints and limitations

Be clear about what the model should and shouldn't do.

**Example:**
```
You are a movie recommendation agent. You should:
- Only recommend movies from the top global trending list
- Not ask for personal information
- Respond with "Sorry, couldn't find a movie to recommend today" if no suitable movie is available
- Keep recommendations brief and engaging
```

### Iterate and refine

Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Start with a basic prompt and refine it based on the results you get.

**Iteration process:**
1. Write an initial prompt
2. Test it with various inputs
3. Analyze the results
4. Identify areas for improvement
5. Refine the prompt
6. Repeat until satisfied

### Common pitfalls to avoid

**Being too vague:**
```
Bad: "Make this better"
Good: "Rewrite this paragraph to be more concise and professional, targeting a business audience"
```

**Not providing context:**
```
Bad: "Explain this"
Good: "Explain the concept of machine learning to a high school student with no technical background"
```

**Ignoring output format:**
```
Bad: "List the benefits"
Good: "List the top 5 benefits of renewable energy in a numbered list format"
```

**Not setting boundaries:**
```
Bad: "Write a story"
Good: "Write a 200-word science fiction story suitable for teenagers, avoiding any violent content"
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

*Content from [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)*

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting involves giving the model a task without providing any examples. The model relies on its pre-trained knowledge to understand and execute the task.

**Example:**
```
Classify the sentiment of the following text as positive, negative, or neutral:

Text: "I love this new AI assistant!"
Sentiment:
```

### Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides a few examples to help the model understand the expected format and style.

**Example:**
```
Classify the sentiment of the following texts:

Text: "This product is amazing!"
Sentiment: positive

Text: "I'm disappointed with the service."
Sentiment: negative

Text: "The weather is cloudy today."
Sentiment: neutral

Text: "I love this new AI assistant!"
Sentiment:
```

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to show its reasoning process step by step.

**Example:**
```
Let's approach this step by step:

Question: If a store has 15 apples and sells 3 each day, how many days until they have 6 apples left?

Let's think through this:
1. Starting with 15 apples
2. Selling 3 per day means: 15 - 3 = 12 (day 1), 12 - 3 = 9 (day 2), 9 - 3 = 6 (day 3)
3. So it takes 3 days to reach 6 apples

Answer: 3 days
```

### Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (Zero-shot CoT)

Zero-shot CoT involves adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts without providing examples.

**Example:**
```
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?

Let's think step by step.
```

<figcaption>Figure 3. Automatic Chain-of-Thought - Credit: [www.promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fauto-cot.642d9bad.png&w=3840&q=75)</figcaption>

### Self-Consistency

Self-consistency involves generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces reasoning errors
- Improves accuracy on complex problems
- Provides confidence in the answer

### Generate Knowledge Prompting

This technique asks the model to generate relevant knowledge before answering a question.

**Example:**
```
Before answering the question, let's generate some relevant knowledge:

Question: How does climate change affect agriculture?

Let me generate some knowledge about this topic:
1. Climate change affects temperature patterns
2. Changes in precipitation impact crop growth
3. Extreme weather events can damage crops
4. CO2 levels can affect plant growth

Now, based on this knowledge, here's the answer...
```

### Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining breaks complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

**Example:**
```
Step 1: Extract key information from the text
Step 2: Analyze the extracted information
Step 3: Generate insights based on the analysis
Step 4: Format the insights into a report
```

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Tree of thoughts explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, like a decision tree.

**Process:**
1. Generate multiple initial thoughts
2. Evaluate each thought
3. Expand promising thoughts
4. Select the best path

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines retrieval of relevant documents with text generation.

**Components:**
- **Retriever**: Finds relevant documents
- **Generator**: Creates responses based on retrieved content
- **Reranker**: Orders retrieved documents by relevance

### Automatic Reasoning and Tool Use

This technique enables models to use external tools and APIs for enhanced capabilities.

**Tools can include:**
- Calculators for mathematical operations
- Search engines for real-time information
- APIs for specific domain knowledge
- Code execution environments

### ReAct Framework

ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) combines reasoning with action-taking capabilities.

**Process:**
1. **Reason**: Think about what needs to be done
2. **Act**: Take action using available tools
3. **Observe**: See the results of the action
4. **Repeat**: Continue until the task is complete

### Reflexion

Reflexion allows models to reflect on their own reasoning and improve their responses.

**Steps:**
1. Generate initial response
2. Reflect on the response quality
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Generate improved response

### Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)

PAL integrates programming capabilities with language models for enhanced reasoning.

**Features:**
- Code generation for problem-solving
- Mathematical computation
- Logical reasoning through code execution
- Structured output through programming

### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

DPO is a technique for fine-tuning language models based on human preferences.

**Process:**
1. Collect preference data from humans
2. Train model to align with preferences
3. Optimize for desired behaviors
4. Maintain model capabilities

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Clear Instructions**: Be explicit about what you want
2. **Role Definition**: Define the AI's role clearly
3. **Format Specification**: Specify exact output format
4. **Example Provision**: Include examples when helpful
5. **Constraint Setting**: Define limitations and requirements

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague Instructions**: Unclear or ambiguous prompts
2. **Missing Context**: Insufficient background information
3. **Format Inconsistency**: Not specifying output format
4. **Over-complexity**: Making prompts unnecessarily complex
5. **Lack of Testing**: Not validating prompts with different inputs

### Context Engineering

Effective context management is crucial for successful prompting:

**Context Types:**
