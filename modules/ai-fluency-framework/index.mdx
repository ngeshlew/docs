    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> "Translate this text to Spanish"</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Best Practices:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide clear, specific instructions</li>
    <li>Define expected output format</li>
    <li>Include quality criteria</li>
    <li>Review outputs for accuracy</li>
  </ul>

<Card title="Agency with Claude">
  <h4>Agency Examples:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Virtual Assistant:</strong> Claude manages email responses based on general guidelines</li>
    <li><strong>Content Moderator:</strong> Claude reviews and flags inappropriate content</li>
    <li><strong>Research Assistant:</strong> Claude continuously monitors and summarizes new information</li>

  <h4>Large Language Models (LLMs):</h4>
  <p>Generative AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.</p>
  
  <h4>Claude:</h4>
  <p>Anthropic's family of large language models, designed with constitutional AI principles for safety and helpfulness.</p>
  
  <h4>Parameters:</h4>
  <p>The mathematical values within an AI model that determine how it processes information and relates different pieces of language to each other. Modern LLMs contain billions of parameters.</p>
</Card>

### Technical Architecture

<Card title="AI Model Architecture">
  <h4>Neural Networks:</h4>
  <p>Computing systems similar to, but distinct from, biological brains. Composed of interconnected nodes organized in layers that learn patterns from data through training.</p>
  
  <h4>Transformer Architecture:</h4>
  <p>The breakthrough AI design from 2017 that enables LLMs to process sequences of text in parallel while paying attention to relationships between words across long passages.</p>
  
  <h4>Scaling Laws:</h4>
  <p>As AI models have grown larger and trained on more data with more computing power, their performance has improved in consistent patterns. New capabilities can emerge at certain scale thresholds.</p>
</Card>

### Training and Capabilities

<Card title="AI Training Process">
  <h4>Pre-training:</h4>
  <p>The initial training phase where AI models learn patterns from vast amounts of text data, developing a foundational understanding of language and knowledge.</p>
  
  <h4>Fine-tuning:</h4>
  <p>Additional training after pre-training where models learn to follow instructions, provide helpful responses, and avoid generating harmful content.</p>
  
  <h4>Context Window:</h4>
  <p>The amount of information an AI can consider at one time, including the conversation history and any documents you've shared. Has a maximum limit that varies by model.</p>
</Card>

### AI Limitations and Considerations

<Card title="Understanding AI Limitations">
  <h4>Hallucination:</h4>
  <p>A type of error when AI confidently states something that sounds plausible, but is actually incorrect.</p>
  
  <h4>Knowledge Cutoff Date:</h4>
  <p>The point after which an AI model has no built-in knowledge of the world, based on when it was trained.</p>
  
  <h4>Bias:</h4>
  <p>Systematic patterns in AI outputs that unfairly favor or disadvantage certain groups or perspectives, often reflecting patterns in training data.</p>
</Card>

## Prompt Engineering Concepts

### Core Prompting Techniques

<Card title="Prompt Engineering Fundamentals">

  <h4>Role or Persona Definition:</h4>
  <p>Specifying a particular character, expertise level, or communication style for the AI to adopt when responding. Can range from general roles ("speak as a UX design expert") to specific personas ("explain this like Richard Feynman would").</p>
  
  <h4>Output Constraints / Output Formatting:</h4>
  <p>Clearly specifying within your prompt the desired format, length, structure, or other characteristics of the AI's response to ensure you get exactly what you need.</p>
</Card>

### Claude-Specific Prompting

<Card title="Claude Prompting Best Practices">
  <h4>Think-First Approach:</h4>
  <p>Explicitly asking Claude to work through its reasoning process before providing a final answer, which can lead to more thorough and well-considered responses.</p>

### 2. **Show Examples of What "Good" Looks Like**

<Card title="Few-Shot Learning with Examples">
  <h4>Before (No Examples):</h4>
  ```Please convert this technical statement to plain language: 
"The platform implements end-to-end encryption protocols to safeguard data integrity."
```
  
  <h4>After (With Examples):</h4>
  ```Here are two examples of how to convert technical jargon into plain language:

1. "The quantum algorithm exhibits quadratic speedup." → 
   "The new method solves problems roughly twice as fast as previous methods."

2. "The interface leverages intuitive design paradigms." → 
   "The design is easy to understand and use."

Now, please convert this technical statement to plain language: 
"The platform implements end-to-end encryption protocols to safeguard data integrity."
