# Advanced Prompting Techniques

> Master advanced prompting techniques for complex AI interactions and sophisticated use cases.

## What are Advanced Prompting Techniques?

Advanced prompting techniques go beyond basic prompt engineering to include sophisticated methods for handling complex tasks, multi-step reasoning, and specialized AI interactions. These techniques enable more powerful and nuanced AI applications.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to show its reasoning process step by step, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

### Basic CoT Example

**Prompt:**
```
Let's approach this step by step:

Question: If a store has 15 apples and sells 3 each day, how many days until they have 6 apples left?

Let's think through this:
1. Starting with 15 apples
2. Selling 3 per day means: 15 - 3 = 12 (day 1), 12 - 3 = 9 (day 2), 9 - 3 = 6 (day 3)
3. So it takes 3 days to reach 6 apples

Answer: 3 days
```

### Zero-shot CoT

For models that can reason without examples:

**Prompt:**
```
Let's solve this step by step:

Question: [Your complex question here]

Let's think through this:
```

## Few-Shot Prompting

Provide multiple examples to help the model understand the expected format and style.

### Classification Example

**Prompt:**
```
Classify the sentiment of the following texts:

Text: "This product is amazing!"
Sentiment: positive

Text: "I'm disappointed with the service."
Sentiment: negative

Text: "The weather is cloudy today."
Sentiment: neutral

Text: "I love this new AI assistant!"
Sentiment:
```

## Self-Consistency

Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most consistent answer.

### Implementation

```python
def self_consistency_prompting(question, num_paths=5):
    prompts = []
    for i in range(num_paths):
        prompt = f"""
        Let's solve this step by step (approach \{i+1\}):

        Question: \{question\}

        Let's think through this:
        """
        prompts.append(prompt)
    
    return prompts
```

## Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously to find the best solution.

### ToT Structure

```python
class TreeOfThoughts:
    def __init__(self, max_depth=3, branching_factor=3):
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.branching_factor = branching_factor
    
    def generate_thoughts(self, prompt, current_thoughts):
        # Generate multiple possible next thoughts
        thoughts = []
        for _ in range(self.branching_factor):
            thought = self.generate_next_thought(prompt, current_thoughts)
            thoughts.append(thought)
        return thoughts
    
    def evaluate_thoughts(self, thoughts):
        # Evaluate the quality of each thought
        scores = []
        for thought in thoughts:
            score = self.evaluate_thought(thought)
            scores.append(score)
        return scores
```

## ReAct Framework

Reasoning + Acting: Combine reasoning with tool use for complex problem-solving.

### ReAct Prompt Structure

```python
react_prompt = """
You have access to the following tools:
\{tools\}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [\{tool_names\}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Question: \{question\}
"""
```

## Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)

Use programming to solve mathematical and logical problems.

### PAL Example

**Prompt:**
```
Solve this problem step by step:

Question: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its speed in km/h?

Let's solve this using Python:

```python
# Calculate speed
distance = 120  # km
time = 2  # hours
speed = distance / time
print(f"Speed: \{speed\} km/h")
```

Answer: The train's speed is 60 km/h.
```

## Meta-Prompting

Use prompts to generate or improve other prompts.

### Meta-Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
```
You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to create a prompt that will help an AI assistant write engaging blog posts.

Create a prompt that:
1. Specifies the target audience
2. Defines the tone and style
3. Includes specific requirements for structure
4. Provides examples of what makes a good blog post

Your prompt should be clear, specific, and actionable.
```

## Advanced Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Iterative Refinement

- Start with a basic prompt
- Test with various inputs
- Analyze failures and edge cases
- Refine based on results
- Repeat until satisfied

### 2. Context Management

- Provide relevant background information
- Include necessary constraints
- Specify the desired output format
- Set clear boundaries and limitations

### 3. Error Handling

- Anticipate potential failures
- Provide fallback instructions
- Include validation criteria
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Minimize token usage where possible
- Use efficient prompt structures
- Leverage model capabilities effectively
- Balance complexity with clarity

## Implementation Examples

### Complex Reasoning Task

```python
def complex_reasoning_prompt(problem, context, constraints):
    return f"""
    You are an expert problem solver. Analyze the following problem step by step.

    CONTEXT:
    \{context\}

    PROBLEM:
    \{problem\}

    CONSTRAINTS:
    \{constraints\}

    APPROACH:
    1. Break down the problem into smaller parts
    2. Identify key variables and relationships
    3. Apply relevant principles or formulas
    4. Check your work for consistency
    5. Provide a clear, step-by-step solution

    Please solve this step by step:
    """
```

### Multi-Modal Prompting

```python
def multimodal_prompt(text, image_description, task):
    return f"""
    You are analyzing both text and visual information.

    TEXT: \{text\}
    IMAGE: \{image_description\}

    TASK: \{task\}

    Please provide a comprehensive analysis that considers both the text and visual elements.
    """
```

## Evaluation and Testing

### Prompt Testing Framework

```python
class PromptTester:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.test_cases = []
    
    def add_test_case(self, input_data, expected_output, description):
        self.test_cases.append({
            'input': input_data,
            'expected': expected_output,
            'description': description
        })
    
    def run_tests(self, prompt_template):
        results = []
        for test_case in self.test_cases:
            prompt = prompt_template.format(**test_case['input'])
            response = self.model.generate(prompt)
            
            # Evaluate response
            score = self.evaluate_response(response, test_case['expected'])
            results.append({
                'test_case': test_case['description'],
                'response': response,
                'score': score,
                'passed': score >= 0.8
            })
        
        return results
```
