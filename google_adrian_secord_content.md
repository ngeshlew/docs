# United by Design

Design Notes is a podcast by Liam Spradlin about creative work and what it teaches us. This season begins with a special series [celebrating ten years since the launch of Material Design,](https://design.google/library/celebrating-ten-years-of-material-design) which explores the inception, evolution, and future of Google’s design system.

The fourth episode in the series features Adrian Secord, who describes himself as a “roving engineer.” He has over a decade of experience building systems and tools that transform design into robust product engineering at scale. Here, he reflects on the evolution of Material Design and the (potentially) exciting possibilities for AI-driven UI. He shares insights on the complexities of large-scale design systems and highlights the need for designers and engineers to find common ground.
