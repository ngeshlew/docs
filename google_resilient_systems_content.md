# Towards Resilient Systems

Google AI’s Strategy & Research team thinks we have a lot to learn from ants, fungi, stony coral, and forest canopies because their success is measured not through the benefit of a few, but through the health of a collective system. As the dominant computing paradigm shifts from personal to ambient, the relationship between many actors, ecologies, and timescales becomes more important. The team believes that examining resilience across natural, human, and technical systems and applying these models to design theory and tool-making is critical for building AI systems that can adapt and thrive regardless of changing environments. Here, they walk us through six qualities at play in some of nature’s resilient systems.
