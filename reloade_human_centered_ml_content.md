Josh Lovejoy and Jess Holbrook have published [a great article titled Human-Centered Machine Learning](https://medium.com/google-design/human-centered-machine-learning-a770d10562cd) which looks at steps to stay focused on the user when designing with ML.

Some of the challenges Iâ€™m learning about and very much are discussed in the article include dealing with false positives and false negatives, algorithm labelling and co-learning and adaptation.

These points aim to help designers navigate the new terrain of designing ML-driven products. by putting the user first, iterating quickly and understanding the unique opportunities machine learning can create.
