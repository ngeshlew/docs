# ML and the Evolution of Web-Based Experiences: Fast, Real-Time, and Fully Interactive

The advent of Machine Learning (ML) is clearly a groundbreaking moment in modern computer science. As designers—and as users—we’ve already seen tangible impacts: ML can [help to transform medical diagnoses](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/healthcare-biosciences), [improve energy efficiency in data centers](https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/safety-first-ai-autonomous-data-center-cooling-and-industrial-control/), and even [identify bowls of ramen by shop](https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/noodle-machine-learning-can-identify-ramen-shop/).

ML has also enabled the development of new, cutting-edge products and user experiences, creating exciting opportunities for web designers. In March, Google announced [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), TensorFlow’s open-source framework for ML with JavaScript. [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) lets web developers train and deploy ML models right in web browsers like Google Chrome. In other words, ML is now publicly available and accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. But what does this really mean for web designers?
