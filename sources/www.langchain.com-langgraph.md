> Synthesis: TODO

## Controllable cognitive architecture for any task
LangGraph's flexible framework supports diverse control flows â single agent, multi-agent, hierarchical, sequential â and robustly handles realistic, complex scenarios.
Ensure reliability with easy-to-add moderation and quality loops that prevent agents from veering off course.
Use LangGraph Platform to templatize your cognitive architecture so that tools, prompts, and models are easily configurable with LangGraph Platform Assistants.
