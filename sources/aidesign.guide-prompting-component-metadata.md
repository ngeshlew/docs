# aidesign.guide-prompting-component-metadata

> Synthesis: TODO

Prompts for managing component metadata.
From the selected Figma component, extract all of its properties, including variants, and generate a TypeScript interface for it.
Analyze the selected component in Figma and create a Markdown table that summarizes its key properties, such as variants, sizes, and states.
List all the design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) used in the selected Figma component.
Based on the selected Figma component, generate a README.md file that includes:
- A brief description of the component
- A list of its properties and variants
- A code example of how to use it in React
For the selected component, write a set of user stories that describe its different use cases and interactions.
Generate a Storybook stories file for the selected Figma component (add link). Include controls for all of its props so the team can interact with it.
Draft a Slack message for our #design-system channel that introduces the latest updates to the selected Figma component. Include a summary of the changes and a link to the Figma file.
Create a JSON object that represents the metadata of the selected Figma component. Include its name, properties, and a list of all used design tokens.
