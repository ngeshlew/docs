# aidesign.guide-guides-key-terms

> Synthesis: TODO

A designerâ€™s guide to important technical terms for working with AI and development.
.env files or needing to set environment variables when working with AI tools or setting up a project locally. This is how you securely provide your personal API keys (like from OpenAI or other services) to the project without sharing them publicly.
.env and add a line like
OPENAI_API_KEY='your_secret_key_here'. The application knows to look in this file for the key it needs.
