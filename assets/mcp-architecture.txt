MCP Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This would show:
- MCP Host (Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, etc.)
- MCP Client (1:1 relationship with servers)
- MCP Servers (local or remote)
- Data Sources (local files, databases, remote APIs)

The diagram would illustrate the flow from Host -> Client -> Server -> Data Sources
