The [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/) synthesize more than 20 years of thinking and research in human-AI interaction. Developed in a collaboration between Aether, Microsoft Research, and Office, the guidelines were validated through a rigorous, 4-step process described in the CHI 2019 paper, [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/). They recommend best practices for how AI systems should behave upon initial interaction, during regular interaction, when theyâ€™re inevitably wrong, and over time.

We hope you can use these [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/) throughout your design process as you evaluate existing ideas, brainstorm new ones, and collaborate with the multiple disciplines involved in creating AI.
