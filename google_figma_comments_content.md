# Always Read the Comments

It’s an internet truism that if you want to maintain your sanity, you should never read the comments.

More than [one in four Americans have had their day ruined by a mean online comment](https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/19047-26-americans-say-negative-internet-comment-has-rui), and many influencers and brands are shutting off comments entirely. However, research suggests that's not the best approach. [A study from the Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2024/08/research-what-happens-when-influencers-turn-off-comments) found that turning off comments can actually make people see influencers as less likable and sincere — even more so than if they just left the negative comments up.

As a UX Designer and the manager of the [Material 3 Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) — a Figma library with 3.5 million users and counting — I’ve had to learn the hard way [not to take negative feedback personally](https://uxdesign.cc/dont-take-design-critique-as-an-insult-6cf187ca6308). Today, I’ve fully embraced comments. I believe that reading and considering this feedback is an essential part of making a valuable design resource. Whether positive or negative, user feedback helps me and the Material team get people what they need.

Read on for the most helpful comments I’ve received on our Figma library, and what I learned along the way.
