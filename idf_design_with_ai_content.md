Rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning continue to transform our world. How can we as designers use AI to our advantage? Product designers and design strategy practitioners are affected by the AI megatrend in 2 key ways:

AI as a product design material – AI enables solutions that are smarter, faster and able to answer questions well beyond that of human capability. However, they need to be deployed effectively and responsibly to be successful.

AI as the designer of your product – As witnessed over the last decade, AI can generate oil paintings and music based solely on a set of input requirements. Emerging AI can now design entire digital user experiences, code them, and deploy to the cloud with one button click.

So while AI automation can be incredibly valuable,  it also carries spectacular risk when deployed within life and death systems (such as autonomous vehicles and medical products). Simultaneously, generative AI for product design carries significant liability risk plus the potential of employment disruption for creative and strategic job careers.

Through various case studies, Professor Daniel Rosenberg will demonstrate how to design with and for AI.

You’ll learn:

Daniel Rosenberg is the 2019 recipient of the SigCHI Lifetime Practice Award for his combinations of technical and leadership contributions to the field over the past 40+ years.

Currently, he is a UX consultant and an adjunct professor of HCI at San Jose State University. He serves on the advisory board of the Interaction Design Foundation and for 5 years edited the “Business of UX” Forum in ACM Interactions magazine.

Dan invented many of the standard GUI design patterns we use today during the early days of the software industry, when he worked as a User Interface Architect for Ashton-Tate & Borland. These include the first GUI Integrated Development Environment, defining the workspace style UX for programming and creative tools. He invented Tabs as a UI mechanism and also designed the first GUI administration UX while he was the UX VP at Oracle.

Over the course of his career, Dan has introduced many UX methods that are now common practice. Documented examples include coauthoring the Rapid Prototyping chapter in the first Handbook of HCI (Elsevier 1988). At a CHI1988 special session he introduced the UX community to the concept of GUI look and feel as an integral part of corporate branding. During this same period, he coauthored Human Factors in Product Design (Elsevier 1991), the first consumer product focused HF textbook which revolutionized both design education and practice for over a decade.

With his book UX Magic, published by IxDF, Dan shares his cumulative knowledge of IxD science, theory and practice in a comprehensive new method that he hopes will once again propel the whole HCI field to greater success.
