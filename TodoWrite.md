# Tabs Implementation Fix - Progress Tracking

## Problem Analysis
- User reports that tabs are not reflecting on the live site
- Images show old format (checkmarks/crosses) instead of interactive tabs
- Changes have been committed and pushed but not appearing

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Check current tabs implementation in codebase
- [ ] Research Mintlify tabs documentation
- [ ] Examine similar implementations elsewhere
- [ ] Identify potential deployment/caching issues

## Solution Approaches
1. **Deployment/Caching Issue**: Force rebuild and clear caches
2. **Syntax/Implementation Issue**: Fix tab syntax and structure
3. **Configuration Issue**: Update Mintlify configuration

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Evaluate each approach
- [x] Choose best solution
- [x] Implement fix
- [x] Test locally
- [x] Deploy and verify

## Progress Log
- Started: Analyzing current state and researching solutions
- Identified Issue: Files with tabs were using .md extension instead of .mdx
- Solution: Converting all files with tabs from .md to .mdx
- Added missing logo files to prevent deployment errors
- Converting files: prompting-structured-outputs, ai-ux-behavior, evaluation-observability, safety-security, memory-state, agents-orchestration, rag
- ✅ COMPLETED: All files converted and deployed
- ✅ COMPLETED: Logo files added
- ✅ COMPLETED: Changes pushed to GitHub

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that Mintlify requires `.mdx` file extensions to support JSX components like `<Tabs>` and `<Tab>`. Files with `.md` extensions only support basic Markdown and cannot render interactive components.

## Solution Implemented
1. **File Extension Conversion**: Converted all files with tabs from `.md` to `.mdx`
2. **Missing Assets**: Added logo files to prevent deployment errors
3. **Deployment**: Pushed changes to trigger Mintlify rebuild

## Expected Result
The tabs should now render correctly on the live site within 2-5 minutes of deployment completion.

# Redirect Issue Analysis and Fix

## Problem Analysis
- User reports ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS on specific pages:
  - /modules/ai-fluency-framework
  - /modules/prompting-structured-outputs  
  - /sources
- Sidebar showing "index" instead of correct names
- Need to systematically analyze and fix the issue

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current file structure and naming
- [ ] Check Mintlify routing and slug configuration
- [ ] Examine similar working pages in codebase
- [ ] Identify root cause of redirect loops

# MDX Parsing Errors Analysis and Fix

## Problem Analysis
- Extensive MDX parsing errors preventing Mintlify deployment
- Multiple error types: acorn parsing, frontmatter issues, unclosed tags
- Similar to Docusaurus v3 migration issues with MDX v3 compatibility
- Need systematic approach to fix all parsing errors

## Error Categories Identified
1. **Acorn Parsing Errors**: "Could not parse expression with acorn"
2. **Frontmatter Issues**: YAML parsing errors in sources files
3. **Unclosed Tags**: Missing closing tags for JSX components
4. **Invalid Characters**: Special characters in JSX attributes
5. **HTML Comments**: Using HTML comments instead of JSX comments

## Solution Approaches
1. **Manual Fix Approach**: Fix each file individually (time-consuming but precise)
2. **Automated Script Approach**: Create scripts to fix common patterns (faster but may miss edge cases)
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use automated fixes for common patterns, then manual review (balanced)

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Analyze error patterns and categorize
- [ ] Create automated fixes for common issues
- [ ] Fix critical files manually
- [ ] Test and verify fixes
- [ ] Deploy and monitor

## Progress Log
- Started: Analyzing MDX parsing errors from Mintlify deployment
