# Week 2: Prompting & Structured Outputs

## Why This Week Matters for Designers

AI features are only as good as their prompts. This week teaches you how to design AI interactions that are reliable, predictable, and user-friendly. You'll learn to think like a prompt engineer while maintaining your focus on user experience.

**Designer Lens:** We'll treat prompts as design artifacts - they're the instructions that shape how AI behaves for your users.

## Weekly Overview

**Theme:** Prompting & Structured Outputs  
**Time Investment:** 4 sessions × 30 minutes = 2 hours  
**Key Outcome:** You'll be able to design AI interactions that are reliable and provide good user experiences.

## Sessions

### Session 5: Prompt Patterns & UX Design (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Basic prompt engineering principles
- How prompt design affects user experience
- Common prompt patterns and their UX implications

**Materials:**
- [Prompting Techniques Overview](/modules/prompting-techniques/index)

**Activity:** Redesign one messy prompt → product-ready prompt

**Deliverable:** `week02-session05-prompt-redesign.md` - Your improved prompt design

<Tip>
Think of prompts as user interface design. Just like you design UI elements to guide user behavior, you design prompts to guide AI behavior.
</Tip>

### Session 6: Structured Outputs & User Experience (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to design reliable AI responses
- Using structured outputs to improve UX
- Handling errors and edge cases gracefully

**Materials:**
- [Structured Outputs](/modules/structured-outputs/index)

**Activity:** Create JSON schema for a user-facing AI feature

**Deliverable:** `week02-session06-structured-schema.md` - Your structured output schema

<Info>
Structured outputs are like form validation for AI responses. They help ensure the AI gives you exactly what you need in a predictable format.
</Info>

### Session 7: Error Handling & Fallbacks (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Designing graceful failure modes for AI
- Maintaining user trust during AI errors
- Creating fallback experiences

**Materials:**
- [AI UX Behavior](/modules/ai-ux-behavior/index)

**Activity:** Sketch error states for AI feature

**Deliverable:** `week02-session07-error-designs.md` - Your error handling designs

<Warning>
AI will make mistakes. Your job is to design experiences that handle these mistakes gracefully and maintain user trust.
</Warning>

### Session 8: Prompting Best Practices (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Advanced prompting techniques for better UX
- Optimizing prompts for user outcomes
- Testing and iterating on prompt design

**Materials:**
- [Advanced Prompting](/modules/prompting-advanced/index)

**Activity:** Create prompt evaluation rubric

**Deliverable:** `week02-session08-prompt-rubric.md` - Your prompt evaluation framework

<Check>
By the end of this week, you should be able to design AI interactions that are reliable, predictable, and provide good user experiences.
</Check>

## Mini-Activities Between Sessions

**Between Sessions 5-6:** Test a prompt with different inputs and observe how the AI responds. Note what makes responses more or less reliable.

**Between Sessions 6-7:** Look at an existing AI feature and identify potential failure points. How could you design better error handling?

**Between Sessions 7-8:** Practice writing prompts for a simple task. Focus on clarity and reliability.

## Weekly Deliverables

1. **Improved Prompt Design** - Your redesigned prompt with UX improvements
2. **Structured Output Schema** - JSON schema for reliable AI responses
3. **Error Handling Designs** - Sketches of graceful failure modes
4. **Prompt Evaluation Rubric** - Framework for testing prompt quality

## Reflection Questions

- What makes a prompt "good" from a user experience perspective?
- How do you balance AI flexibility with reliability in your designs?
- What error handling patterns felt most important for your users?

## Next Week Preview

Week 3 focuses on **AI UX Behavior & Patterns** - you'll learn how users actually interact with AI and how to design for AI-specific behaviors.
