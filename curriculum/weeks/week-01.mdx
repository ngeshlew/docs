# Week 1: AI Foundations & Product Context

## Why This Week Matters for Designers

As a Senior Product Designer, you're already an expert at understanding user needs and creating intuitive experiences. This week bridges your design expertise with AI capabilities, helping you speak confidently about AI in product discussions and identify where AI can enhance user experiences.

**Designer Lens:** Instead of diving deep into technical AI concepts, we'll focus on how AI capabilities map to user value and product opportunities.

## Weekly Overview

**Theme:** AI Foundations & Product Context  
**Time Investment:** 4 sessions × 30 minutes = 2 hours  
**Key Outcome:** You'll be able to explain AI concepts in product terms and identify AI opportunities in your design work.

## Sessions

### Session 1: AI Landscape & Product Patterns (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How AI fits into modern product design
- Common AI product patterns and their UX implications
- When AI adds value vs. when it's just a gimmick

**Materials:**
- [AI Foundations](/modules/foundations/index)

**Activity:** Write a one-pager mapping AI capabilities to UX value for your current product

**Deliverable:** `week01-session01-notes.md` - Your AI-to-UX mapping document

<Tip>
Focus on user outcomes, not technical capabilities. Ask: "How does this AI feature make the user's life better?"
</Tip>

### Session 2: Model Types & UX Implications (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Different types of AI models and their strengths
- How model choices affect user experience design
- Trade-offs between model capabilities and UX constraints

**Materials:**
- [Transformers & Model Architecture](/modules/transformers/index)

**Activity:** Sketch a UX feature ↔ model type mapping for your product

**Deliverable:** `week01-session02-model-ux-mapping.md` - Visual mapping of features to model types

<Info>
You don't need to understand the technical details of how models work. Focus on what they can do and how that affects your design decisions.
</Info>

### Session 3: AI Product Metrics & Success (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to measure AI feature success from a user perspective
- Balancing technical metrics with user experience metrics
- Designing for measurable user outcomes

**Materials:**
- [Evaluation & Observability](/modules/evaluation-observability/index)

**Activity:** Write 3 success measures for an AI feature in your product

**Deliverable:** `week01-session03-ai-metrics.md` - Your AI success metrics framework

<Warning>
Don't get caught up in technical metrics like accuracy or latency. Focus on user-centered metrics like task completion, satisfaction, and time savings.
</Warning>

### Session 4: AI Fluency Framework (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to communicate AI concepts to different stakeholders
- Building confidence in technical discussions
- Advocating for user needs in AI decisions

**Materials:**
- [AI Fluency Framework](/modules/ai-fluency-framework/index)

**Activity:** Journal entry: "How I'd explain AI to a colleague"

**Deliverable:** `week01-session04-ai-communication.md` - Your AI communication strategy

<Check>
By the end of this week, you should feel confident explaining AI concepts in product terms and identifying AI opportunities in your design work.
</Check>

## Mini-Activities Between Sessions

**Between Sessions 1-2:** Observe how AI is used in products you use daily. Note what works well and what feels awkward.

**Between Sessions 2-3:** Sketch a quick wireframe of how an AI feature could fit into your current product.

**Between Sessions 3-4:** Practice explaining one AI concept to a non-technical colleague.

## Weekly Deliverables

1. **AI-to-UX Mapping Document** - Your analysis of how AI capabilities map to user value
2. **Model Type Mapping** - Visual representation of features to model types
3. **AI Success Metrics** - Framework for measuring AI feature success
4. **AI Communication Strategy** - Your approach to explaining AI concepts

## Reflection Questions

- What surprised you about how AI fits into product design?
- Which AI concepts felt most relevant to your current work?
- What questions do you still have about AI in product design?

## Next Week Preview

Week 2 focuses on **Prompting & Structured Outputs** - you'll learn how to design effective AI interactions and handle the reliability challenges that come with AI-powered features.
