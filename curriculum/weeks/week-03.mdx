# Week 3: AI UX Behavior & Patterns

## Why This Week Matters for Designers

AI creates unique user behaviors and interaction patterns that don't exist in traditional software. This week helps you understand these AI-specific behaviors and apply proven design patterns to create better AI experiences.

**Designer Lens:** We'll study AI user behavior like you study any user behavior - through observation, patterns, and design principles.

## Weekly Overview

**Theme:** AI UX Behavior & Patterns  
**Time Investment:** 4 sessions Ã— 30 minutes = 2 hours  
**Key Outcome:** You'll understand AI-specific user behaviors and know how to design for them effectively.

## Sessions

### Session 9: AI User Behavior Patterns (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How users actually interact with AI features
- Common AI user behavior patterns
- Designing for AI-specific user needs

**Materials:**
- [AI UX Behavior](/modules/ai-ux-behavior/index)

**Activity:** Observe and document AI user behavior

**Deliverable:** `week03-session09-ai-behavior-notes.md` - Your AI behavior observations

<Tip>
AI users often have different expectations and behaviors than traditional software users. Pay attention to how they approach AI features.
</Tip>

### Session 10: Design Patterns for AI (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Proven AI UX design patterns
- Common AI UX pitfalls to avoid
- Applying patterns to your own designs

**Materials:**
- [Design Patterns](/modules/design-patterns/index)

**Activity:** Audit existing AI feature for design patterns

**Deliverable:** `week03-session10-pattern-audit.md` - Your pattern audit findings

<Info>
Design patterns for AI are like design patterns for any interface - they're proven solutions to common problems. Learn them to avoid reinventing the wheel.
</Info>

### Session 11: Streaming UX & Real-time Feedback (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Designing for streaming AI responses
- Creating engaging real-time experiences
- Managing user expectations during generation

**Materials:**
- [Streaming UX](/modules/streaming-ux/index)

**Activity:** Sketch streaming UX for text generation

**Deliverable:** `week03-session11-streaming-design.md` - Your streaming UX designs

<Warning>
Streaming AI responses can feel magical or frustrating depending on how you design them. Focus on managing user expectations and providing clear feedback.
</Warning>

### Session 12: Multimodal AI Experiences (30 min)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Designing for text, image, and voice AI
- Creating cohesive multimodal flows
- Balancing different input/output modalities

**Materials:**
- [Multimodality](/modules/multimodality/index)

**Activity:** Design multimodal AI feature concept

**Deliverable:** `week03-session12-multimodal-concept.md` - Your multimodal design concept

<Check>
By the end of this week, you should understand AI-specific user behaviors and know how to apply proven design patterns to create better AI experiences.
</Check>

## Mini-Activities Between Sessions

**Between Sessions 9-10:** Use an AI feature and pay attention to your own behavior. What feels natural? What feels awkward?

**Between Sessions 10-11:** Look for streaming AI features in products you use. How do they handle the real-time experience?

**Between Sessions 11-12:** Sketch a quick concept for an AI feature that uses multiple modalities (text + image, voice + text, etc.).

## Weekly Deliverables

1. **AI Behavior Observations** - Your notes on how users interact with AI
2. **Pattern Audit Findings** - Analysis of existing AI features using design patterns
3. **Streaming UX Designs** - Sketches for real-time AI experiences
4. **Multimodal Design Concept** - Your concept for a multimodal AI feature

## Reflection Questions

- What AI user behaviors surprised you the most?
- Which design patterns felt most relevant to your work?
- How do you think AI will change user expectations in your product area?

## Next Week Preview

Week 4 focuses on **Advanced Prompting Techniques** - you'll learn sophisticated prompting methods that can create more intelligent and helpful AI experiences.
