# United by Design

Design Notes is a podcast by Liam Spradlin about creative work and what it teaches us. This season begins with a special series [celebrating ten years since the launch of Material Design,](https://design.google/library/celebrating-ten-years-of-material-design) which explores the inception, evolution, and future of Google's design system.

The fourth episode in the series features Adrian Secord, who describes himself as a "roving engineer." He has over a decade of experience building systems and tools that transform design into robust product engineering at scale. Here, he reflects on the evolution of Material Design and the (potentially) exciting possibilities for AI-driven UI. He shares insights on the complexities of large-scale design systems and highlights the need for designers and engineers to find common ground.

# Putting People First: A Look at Google PAIR and Human-Centric AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, but with great power comes great responsibility. At Google, they believe that AI should be developed and deployed with people in mind. That's where People + AI Research (PAIR) comes in.

PAIR is a multidisciplinary team at Google dedicated to the human side of AI. They explore the intersection of AI and humanity through fundamental research, practical tools, design frameworks, and collaboration with diverse communities. Goal? To ensure that AI is beneficial, inclusive, and used responsibly.

Why Human-Centric AI?

AI has the potential to revolutionize countless fields, from healthcare and education to scientific discovery and creative expression. However, if not developed thoughtfully, AI can exacerbate existing inequalities, create privacy concerns, and become opaque and difficult to understand.

By prioritizing a human-centric approach, we aim to:

- Ensure Fairness and Inclusion: We strive to mitigate bias in AI systems and ensure they work for everyone, not just a select few.
- Promote Transparency and Explainability: We believe users should understand how AI decisions are made, fostering trust and responsible development.
