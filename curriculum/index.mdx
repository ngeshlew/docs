# AI/ML Curriculum for Senior Product Designers

## Your Bridge to AI Fluency

Welcome to a **12-week, 30-minute-every-2-days** learning journey designed specifically for Senior Product Designers who want to meaningfully contribute to AI product strategy, UX decisions, and stakeholder discussions.

<Card title="Quick Start" icon="rocket" href="/curriculum/weeks/week-01">
Jump into Week 1 and start building your AI fluency in just 30 minutes.
</Card>

## Why This Curriculum Exists

Imagine you're a Senior Product Designer working in a global non-profit, sitting at the table with engineers, PMs, and researchers who are building AI-driven tools. You know **good design is about shaping how technology feels, not just how it works.** But in AI discussions, you sometimes feel sidelined because the conversation gets too technical.

This curriculum is your bridge:

- **Every 2 days, you invest 30 focused minutes** â€” enough to build confidence without derailing your workday
- You don't want to be an ML engineer, but you want to **speak the language, spot risks, and advocate for users**
- You learn best through **real product patterns, UX implications, and storytelling artifacts** (PRDs, UX flows, evaluation rubrics)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you'll be able to:
